"        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this\nlittle problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that\nwe did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  \nThis is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are\nusually more complex than this example I will use here.\n        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration\nof 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,\nits flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the\ntime.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\nR=8800Mpc.  \n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\nold standby formula:\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty\nenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\nAnd lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call\nmoderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that\nmuch energy in one second? \n                                                -jeremy\n\n\n\n"
"\nBut if He/She did you would probably consider it rape.  \n\n\nObviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?\n\n\nNo one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let\nme ask you a question.  Do you beleive what you learn in history class, or for\nthat matter anything in school.  I mean it's just what other people have told\nyou and you don't want to swallow what others say. right ... ?\n\nThe life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.  As much\nas anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and what not to?\nI could argue that George Washington is a myth.  He never lived because I don't\nhave any proof except what I am told.   However all the major events of the life\nof Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before him.  Neat trick uh?"

"\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\nby itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\nthe resulting reduced material.\n\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\n\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\n\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about\nit."

"RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992\n\n\t\tWHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE\n\nI. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea."
