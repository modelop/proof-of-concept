# Getting-Started

Welcome to the Getting Started Repo!

This repo contains configuration files and example models to help you get started with FastScore.

## Prerequisites

To start up the environment, you will need to have Docker installed. 
`sudo apt-get install docker.io`

Itâ€™s also useful (recommended but not mandatory) to have Docker Compose installed. Installation instructions can be found [here](docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

We will also need the FastScore CLI installed to interact with FastScore. 

Download the CLI by following the instructions in this [guide](https://opendatagroup.github.io/Reference/FastScore%20CLI/).
